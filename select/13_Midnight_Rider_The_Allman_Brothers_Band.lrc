[00:15.38] Well, I've got to run to keep from hiding
[00:20.43] And I'm bound to keep on riding
[00:25.14] And I've got one more silver dollar
[00:29.72] But I'm not gon' let 'em catch me, no
[00:33.22] Not gon' let 'em catch the midnight rider
[00:53.72] 
[00:45.79] I don't own the clothes I'm wearing
[00:50.91] And the road goes on forever
[00:55.53] I've got one more silver dollar
[01:00.98] But I'm not gon' let 'em catch me, no
[01:03.65] Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
[01:24.65] 
[01:54.13] And I've gone by the point of caring
[01:59.32] Some old bed I'll soon be sharing
[02:04.58] And I've got one more silver dollar
[02:09.39] But I'm not gon' let 'em catch me, no
[02:12.01] Not gon' let 'em catch the midnight rider
[02:20.13] No, I'm not gon' let 'em catch me, no
[02:22.46] Not gon' let 'em catch the midnight rider
[02:30.27] No, I'm not gon' let 'em catch me, no
