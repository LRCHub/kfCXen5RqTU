Midnight
The best 遊び場
There’s none alike
それは My own time
Midnight
It’s 孤独と二人きり
Just like
I’m learning myself
目を閉じれば　いつも来れるんだ
A neverland I can go
made just for me
Closing my eyes
Can even 飛べるんだ
暗い夜も綺麗な星と共に
Saying bye to envious
feelings inside
Staying true to my heart’s
what I wanna try
Really makes me blue,
really makes me chase down
some frogs in the dark,
That’s what I gotta do
Midnight
The best 遊び場
真夜中
And my down time
In the dead of night
それは Mountain climb
It’s taking it in
I’m learning myself
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
まさに
Midnight
Said too much of what I’m about
Tell me what your story is about
You seem so chill
What do we have in common
Turns out, not much to bother
Guess I’m the weird one now
All the day
I’m jumping in this mind
Why don’t you go take it easy
you saying like peasy it’s ah
Really makes me blue,
really makes me feel tied up
Stretching with snakes is
what I gotta do
Midnight
The best 遊び場
真夜中
And my down time
In the dead of night
それは Mountain climb
It’s taking it in
I’m learning myself
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
まさに
Midnight
There’s no way
I’ll be tired of
this playground and this life
Midnight
The best 遊び場
真夜中
And my down time
In the dead of night
それは Mountain climb
It’s taking it in
I’m learning myself
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
まさに
Midnight
Why don’t you come to
my neverland
Now don’t be afraid
just come out and play
Whatever it is let’s do
to the dawn
紛れればいいんだ　忘れるまで
Why don’t you come to
my neverland
Yeah You are the cure to
my deepest nights
You are the one to now navigate,
you fascinate,
will you vaccinate
