Midnight in Montgomery
Silver eagle
Lonely road

I was on my way to Mobile
For a big New Year's Eve show
I stopped for just a minute
To see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up
I found his name
And felt the wind die down

And a drunk man in a cowboy hat
Took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots
Nudie suit
And haunting haunted eyes
He said: "Friend it's good to see you"
It's nice to know you care
Then the wind picked up
And he was gone
Was he ever really there?

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whipporwill
See the stars light up
The purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right
You'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there

Well, I climbed back on that eagle
Took one last look around
Through red tail lights
The shadow moved slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train
Is slowly passing by
I could hear that whistle moan
I'm so lonesome I could cry

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whipporwill
And see the stars
Light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right
You'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there

He's always singing there
Hank's always singing there
