(One, two, three)
Four wheels, six strings
Low on smoke and gasoline
Born to live a midnight rider's prayer
Same boots, new crowd
Same tune, new town
Tryna get to Heaven 'fore the Devil even knows we're there
On the road again
Like a band of gypsies, we roll down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turnin' our way
And our way
Go hard, live fast
Play guitars for bar tabs
So if there's a crowd, the show will never end
So we set it up and we tear it down
Four hundred miles to the next town
Gonna drive all night just to do it all over again (do it all over again)
On the road again
Like a band of gypsies, we roll down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turnin' our way
And our way
When your night is ending
Ours is just beginning
On the road again
Like a band of gypsies, we roll down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turnin' our way
And our way
On the road again
Like a band of gypsies, we roll down the highway
Brothers to the end
Insisting that the world keep turnin' our way
And our way
