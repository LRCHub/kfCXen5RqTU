[00:15.05] Well, I've got to run to keep from hiding
[00:19.63] And I'm bound to keep on riding
[00:24.68] And I've got one more silver dollar
[00:29.34] But I'm not gon' let 'em catch me, no
[00:32.99] Not gon' let 'em catch the midnight rider
[00:53.49] 
[00:45.22] I don't own the clothes I'm wearing
[00:50.04] And the road goes on forever
[00:54.58] I've got one more silver dollar
[00:59.85] But I'm not gon' let 'em catch me, no
[01:03.03] Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
[01:24.03] 
[01:51.93] And I've gone by the point of caring
[01:56.88] Some old bed I'll soon be sharing
[02:01.65] And I've got one more silver dollar
[02:07.05] But I'm not gon' let 'em catch me, no
[02:09.98] Not gon' let 'em catch the midnight rider
[02:17.42] No, I'm not gon' let 'em catch me, no
[02:21.62] Not gon' let 'em catch the midnight rider
[02:29.42] No, I'm not gon' let 'em catch me, no
